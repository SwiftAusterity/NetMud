# Warrens
A c# web application text mmorpg platform with a custom web-based client, web-based data editing and administrative dashboard.

You're not going to want the master version of the platform as it is the base platform. There will be many variants each with their own branch.

Warrens: Leaf Green - A unicode graphics visual farming mmorpg, much like Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley.

Warrens: Prismatic Diamond - A more traditional MUD platform based on the Circle engine mechanics.

Warrens: White Sand - A modern, universal entity based MUD platform used in Under the Eclipse.
