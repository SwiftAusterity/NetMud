{"Body":{"Value":"**What is and will be**\r\n\r\nIt's been a busy week. I know the \"new features\" list seems pretty minor this week collectively but the entire platform has undergone a redesign. Fundamental things have been changed to make way for User Generated Content. This means the Crafting UI can be done and the admin creation pages for new Zones, items, NPCs and Tiles as well we Map Editing can be made available to players once the code for recognizing zone-ownership is tested.\r\n\r\nNext week will concentrate on content itself. HMR could probably do with a builder or two given the admin panels are now clearer to use. Use the email on the Contact page or pop into the slack (also on the contact page) to inquire.\r\n\r\n* Making a competent tutorial possible (the tooltip based tutorial is strictly for the UI, need a better one)\r\n* Making some sort of Interaction shortcut so it isn't so awkward to Use and Interact with things.\r\n* Building out the village map\r\n* Making new Farm zones generate with random debris\r\n* Building out the \"Farming\" mechanics with crops and such\r\n\r\n**New Features**\r\n\r\n* Design: New tooltips for clicking on the map (also clicking, not hovering)\r\n* Design: Blog and Journal search options expanded\r\n* Design: Game client map now adds a 2px solid black border if a tile is an \"edge of the world\" tile.\r\n* Design: Hella updates for public pages for items, npcs, everything.\r\n","Length":0},"PublishDate":"2018-09-29T00:00:00","Tags":["Patch Notes"],"Public":true,"MinimumReadLevel":0,"ExpireDate":"2018-10-29T00:00:00","Expired":false,"Id":4,"Created":"2018-09-29T12:03:53.9641875+00:00","LastRevised":"2018-09-29T12:05:17.1175149+00:00","Name":"9-29-2018 Release Notes","CachingType":1,"SuitableForUse":true,"State":2,"ApprovedOn":"2018-09-29T12:05:17.1175149+00:00","CreatorHandle":"SwiftAusterity","CreatorRank":3,"ApproverHandle":"SwiftAusterity","ApproverRank":3}
