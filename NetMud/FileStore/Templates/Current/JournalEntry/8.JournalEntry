{"Body":{"Value":"**What is and will be**\r\n\r\nHUGE huge huge push today. Loads of minor tweaks (and some major) to the client UX and I think we're getting somewhere. The new Key Legend should help people get up to speed with the old and new key bindings. I intend to introduce an account config page for editing keybindings as well.\r\n\r\nLoads of action system changes with a few more to come but the new inventory selection system in the client should help quite a bit with the clunky use command syntax. You can now highlight a usable item in your inventory (visually) and the client will do you the favor of adding in the \"use itemname\" part of the use command. Now you can highlight a watering can and \"water direction\" as long as it stays highlighted and full of water. Additionally self-targeted uses (which will be coming in abundance soon) no longer require a direction to work.\r\n\r\nThis should make farming much easier.\r\n\r\n**System Changes**\r\n* Feature: limit inventory space (to 50)\r\n* Feature: Same item stacking\r\n* Feature: Randomized debris on the personal farm generator\r\n* Feature: Background Music Playlists\r\n* Architecture: Added edit pages for all Action types\r\n* Feature: Alt now toggles batman mode + status tooltips\r\n* Feature: Up/Down (not num arrows, normal ones) now do command history (something netmud already had)\r\n* Feature: Left/Right now cycles through the inventory\r\n* Feature: Make the inventory highlighting system (Active Item) ala stardew that lets you skip parts of the Use command. (you can highlight inventory in the ui already)\r\n* UI: Game client menu now features a toggleable Key Binding Map (static for now, may become configurable later)","Length":0},"PublishDate":"2018-10-16T00:00:00","Tags":["Patch Notes"],"Public":true,"MinimumReadLevel":0,"ExpireDate":"2018-11-17T00:00:00","Expired":false,"Id":8,"Created":"2018-10-18T02:36:34.0057521+00:00","LastRevised":"2018-10-19T00:54:22.5795732+00:00","Name":"10-17-2018 Release Notes","CachingType":1,"SuitableForUse":true,"State":2,"ApprovedOn":"2018-10-19T00:54:22.5795732+00:00","CreatorHandle":"SwiftAusterity","CreatorRank":3,"ApproverHandle":"SwiftAusterity","ApproverRank":3}
