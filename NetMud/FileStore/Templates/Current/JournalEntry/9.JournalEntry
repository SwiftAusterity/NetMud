{"Body":{"Value":"**What is and will be**\r\n\r\nSmall push of just today's items. The music player has been expanded and action results can now be clustered for a random \"loot table\" style chance of occurring.\r\n\r\nMostly this was to fix the Features pages which I had broken by changing the Action format.\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\n* Bugfix: I broke the Action part of the display cards in the Features section. Fixed those.\r\n* Mechanics: Clustered Action Results with choice type and modifier (random chance for one result in grouping)\r\n* Audio: Added a \"loop track\" to the Playable Tracks for background music. You don't need a Playlist anymore to listen to the songs sequentially.","Length":0},"PublishDate":"2018-10-18T00:00:00","Tags":["Patch Notes","Patch Notes"],"Public":true,"MinimumReadLevel":0,"ExpireDate":"2018-11-18T00:00:00","Expired":false,"Id":9,"Created":"2018-10-19T00:53:50.9768671+00:00","LastRevised":"2018-10-19T00:54:07.8492035+00:00","Name":"10-18-2018 Release Notes","CachingType":1,"SuitableForUse":true,"State":2,"ApprovedOn":"2018-10-19T00:54:07.8492035+00:00","CreatorHandle":"SwiftAusterity","CreatorRank":3,"ApproverHandle":"SwiftAusterity","ApproverRank":3}
