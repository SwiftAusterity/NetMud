{"Body":{"Value":"**What was and will be**\r\n\r\nSome major behind the scenes changes still occurring in HMR land. Some big things though: Crafting and the basis for Relationships are in.\r\n\r\nWe're REALLY close to a functional Aleph announcement and this means prior to Beth there will be sdv/hm style romancing the NPCs. Of course this is an mmo so you'll have to keep your lovers' interest as other players can try to woo them.\r\n\r\nBe mindful this is not like stardew valley, Harvest Moon or Fable where you can just keep cramming desired gifts down your lovers' throat. NPCs will have preferences but some of those preferences will be social and moral in nature and being harassed will not be to everyone's liking.\r\n\r\nAside from that, **content will be made soon**. This means the town and a large overhaul to personal farms which ALSO means everyone's farms will be wiped out once content is made and regenerated. Everyone can keep their characters and account names but your farm will get deleted and remade anew.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n* Technical: Administrator dashboard is now a lot nicer and has new inline config editing features.\r\n* Technical: An admin can now lock the entire system down from new registrations or logins under Admin rank.\r\n* Technical: Gossip control is now in the admin with all configurable values editable live.\r\n* Feature: Crafting system and command\r\n* Feature: NPC Personality Matrices","Length":0},"PublishDate":"2018-10-27T00:00:00","Tags":["Patch Notes"],"Public":true,"MinimumReadLevel":0,"ExpireDate":"2018-11-26T00:00:00","Expired":false,"Id":11,"Created":"2018-10-27T14:21:56.9527691+00:00","LastRevised":"2018-10-30T01:05:57.9453326+00:00","Name":"10-27-2018 Release Notes","CachingType":1,"SuitableForUse":true,"State":2,"ApprovedOn":"2018-10-30T01:05:57.9453326+00:00","CreatorHandle":"SwiftAusterity","CreatorRank":3,"ApproverHandle":"SwiftAusterity","ApproverRank":3}
