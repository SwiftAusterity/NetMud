{"HelpText":{"Value":"### Pathways\r\n\r\nPathways are links from one tile to another on the same or a different map. Pathways have a destination and a name. To use a pathway utilize the **Enter** command while standing on the tile of a pathway with the syntax:\r\n\r\nEnter [pathway name]\r\n\r\nPathways are visually denoted by a colored dotted border around a tile. There may be multiple destinations per pathway so check the pathway by mousing over the tile for the right name.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Pathways may not always be easily seen due to color conflicts. You can use _Batman Mode_ to see any potentially hidden pathways. See the help for _Batman Mode_ for more information.","Length":0},"CachingType":2,"Id":1,"Created":"2018-09-18T03:43:03.2438941+00:00","LastRevised":"2018-09-18T03:45:14.7528146+00:00","Name":"Pathways","SuitableForUse":true,"State":2,"ApprovedOn":"2018-09-18T03:45:14.7528146+00:00","CreatorHandle":"SwiftAusterity","CreatorRank":3,"ApproverHandle":"SwiftAusterity","ApproverRank":3}
