        The netMUD platform itself, which is more suited to an actual mud than an ascii farming game, can be found at its <a href="https://www.github.com/swiftausterity/netmud">github repository</a> and
        the live sandbox for netMUD can be experienced on its <a href="https://netmud.swiftausterity.com/">website</a>.
